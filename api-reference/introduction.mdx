<Note>
  JITSâ€™s Public (REST) API provides users an alternative way to programmatically access and manage secrets via HTTPS requests. This can be useful for automating tasks, such as rotating credentials, or for integrating secret management into a larger system.
  With the Public API, you can query account information and booking fund transfer, as well as manage access control, query audit logs, and more.
