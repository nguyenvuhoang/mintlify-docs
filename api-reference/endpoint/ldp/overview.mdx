# System Architecture Description: LDP and EMI

## Overview

The system consists of two main components: **LDB** (Lao Development Bank) and **EMI** (Ekphathana Microfinance Institution), designed to connect and exchange data with each other via APIs. This architecture ensures security through the use of **JWT (JSON Web Token)** for authentication and a **Firewall** to protect data flows between the two systems.

The diagram below illustrates how the components within the system interact with each other:

## Main Components

### 1.  **LDB** (Lao Development Bank)
- **API**: The primary interface of LDP, allowing end-user devices (computers, smartphones) to send requests to the system.
- **Core Banking**: The core system that handles banking operations, including account management, transactions, and other financial activities.
- **End-user Devices**: Users can access the system through computers or smartphones.

### 2. **EMI** (Ekphathana Microfinance Institution)
- **API**: The interface of EMI, which receives requests from LDP and sends responses after processing.
- **Core Banking**: The core system of EMI, responsible for handling account-related operations and transactions on the EMI side.

### 3. Security and Authentication
- **Token Service (JWT)**: A token service generates and validates JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to authenticate requests between LDP and EMI, ensuring secure communication.
- **Firewall**: A firewall is implemented between the two systems to monitor and filter incoming and outgoing traffic, adding an additional layer of security.

## Business Operations

### Money Transfer from LDP to EMI
One of the key operations supported by this architecture is the transfer of money from LDP to EMI. The process is detailed in the steps below:

#### Steps
1. **Authentication: Request to get JWT**
   - 1 or 2: Input contract number to get customer information.
   - EMI API returns customer info based on the contract number.
   
2. **Making transaction with LDP account**
   - Debit from the customer’s account to EMI’s account.

3. **After making the transaction, LDP sends Reference, contract number, and amount to update on EMI System.**


## Conclusion

The LDP and EMI systems are designed to work seamlessly together, enabling secure and efficient financial transactions. The use of JWT for authentication and a firewall for security ensures that data exchanges between the two systems are protected, making this architecture suitable for handling sensitive operations like money transfers.
